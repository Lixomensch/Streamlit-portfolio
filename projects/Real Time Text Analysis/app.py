def process_text(text):
    """
    Process the given text and return the word count, character count, word frequency,
    and top 5 most frequent words.

    Parameters
    ----------
    text : str
        The input text to process

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A tuple of (word_count, char_count, word_freq, top_words)

    Notes
    -----
    The word frequency is a dictionary where the keys are the words and the
    values are the frequencies of the words. The top 5 most frequent words are
    returned as a list of tuples, where the first element of each tuple is the
    word and the second element is the frequency of the word.

    Parameters
    ----------
    word_freq : dict
        A dictionary where the keys are words and the values are their frequencies.

    Notes
    -----
    The word cloud is displayed using Streamlit's pyplot method, and it visualizes 
    the frequency of words with their size in the cloud. Words with higher frequencies 
    appear larger.
